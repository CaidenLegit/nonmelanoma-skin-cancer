    Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer is a type of cancer the skin that is unrelated to melanin.
    <br><br>
    Its caused by overexposure to UV light. <br>
    The skin is what gets affected, obviously. <br>
    It's diagnosed using a skin exam, skin biopsy, and other things. <br>
    <br><br>
    You are more likely to get this type of cancer if you:
    <ul>
      <li>are older</li>
      <li>have pale skin</li>
      <li>have red hair</li>
      <li>have fair hair</li>
      <li>have blue eyes</li>
      <li>have green eyes</li>
      <li>have many freckles/moles</li>
      <li>have had skin cancer in the past</li>
      <li>have a family history of skin cancer</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    There were 331,722 recorded cases of non-melanoma skin cancer in 2022, and over 100,000 of which were from the US.
    <br><br>
    This cancer is usually removed by surgery, but it can depend on the type.
    <br><br>
    You can prevent this type of cancer by:
    <ul>
      <li>not using tanning beds</li>
      <li>not using sunlamps</li>
      <li>wearing sunglasses with 100% UVA/UVB protection</li>
      <li>wearing clothing to shade your body</li>
      <li>using sunscreen</li>
      <li>taking regular skin exams</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    While this cancer is quite easy to get, its also quite easy to remove. Always report early signs to a doctor. <br>
    If it reaches the bloodstream it may spread to other parts of the body, creating much worse cancers.
